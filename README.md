# Python_projects

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This collection features a variety of projects I've worked on to explore and enhance my Python programming skills. Each project showcases different aspects of Python.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each project. Feel free to explore each one!

# Project 1: BMI Calculator

Description:
The BMI Calculator program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height. It takes inputs such as the user's name, weight (in kilograms), and height (in centimeters). After processing the inputs, the program computes the BMI using the formula:

BMI = ((weight / height) / height) * 10000

Once the BMI is calculated, the program evaluates the result against standard BMI categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese) and provides the user with their BMI score along with an interpretation of their weight status.

This tool is simple yet effective for personal health tracking, helping users quickly understand their weight status and encouraging informed decisions about their fitness and lifestyle. Whether for casual use or as part of a health monitoring routine, this program is a handy resource for anyone interested in their well-being.

# Project 2: Folder Sorter

Description:
The Folder Sorter program is designed to automatically organize files within a directory based on their file types. When executed, the program identifies files, categorizes them according to their extensions (e.g., .pdf, .jpg, .docx), and creates corresponding folders for each file type. It then moves the files into their respective folders, resulting in a neatly organized directory structure.

This tool is especially useful for managing cluttered folders with mixed file types. By running the program regularly, users can maintain a tidy workspace, improve accessibility, and save time searching for files. The Folder Sorter is a practical solution for personal, academic, or professional file management needs.


# Project 3: Web Scraping Project

Description:
This project focuses on extracting and organizing data from websites using Python. The program sends HTTP requests to retrieve webpage content, parses HTML structures using BeautifulSoup, and extracts relevant information such as text, links, or other specific elements. The extracted data is then cleaned and formatted into structured formats like CSV or Excel using pandas for further analysis.

The program includes features like error handling to manage connection issues or missing elements and introduces delays to ensure ethical web scraping. This project is ideal for tasks like data collection, research, or automating repetitive online data-gathering processes.
